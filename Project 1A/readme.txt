README for calculator.php

This is a PHP file that calculates an answer from a user-input math expression. The calculator supports +,-,* and / operators (However, it does not support parentheses.) and the evaluation of the input follows the standard operator precedence. It can take both integer and real numbers.

Note that the file was created in Mac OS X Yosemite.
